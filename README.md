Scrape data analyst job opportunities in some European countries

### Project Summary
A brief overview of the data analyst job market in European countries(Portugal, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands)

### Purpose
I plan to study and work in Europe but have not decided where to study. It would be great to gain some information, such as how good the job market is and how many English-speaking jobs there are, in advance. Therefore, I can make a sensible decision to determine where I should study and take advantage of the market.

### Data
LinkedIn job pages

### Result
In conclusion, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and The Netherlands provide relatively more career opportunities than others. Among these countries, the United Kingdom has the most English-speaking roles. However, career is just one of my considerations for postgraduate study.
