# Web-scraping-job-opportunities-of-data-analyst-on-Linkedln
Scrape data analyst job opportunities in some European countries

### Project Summary
A brief overview of the data analyst job market in western Europe

### Purpose
I plan to study and work in one of the western European countries, so I am curious how the job market of a data analyst is. I also want to store the data sets because I might use them for advanced analysis, such as the most common words, language requirements, and the most important skills.

### Data
LinkedIn job pages

### Result
In conclusion, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and The Netherlands provide relatively more career opportunities than others. Furthermore, there are some limitations to web scraping with Selenium. It could take a great amount of time to finish requests and collect data. For job records less than 1000, it is considered acceptable for me. To extract more data, please take advantage of the requests library (using headers, passing data, etc.).
